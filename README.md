## 👤 About Me
I am a deep learning and AI enthusiast with hands-on experience in machine learning, PyTorch, and data-driven model development. My focus is on building practical implementations of neural networks, progressing from fundamentals to advanced architectures like CNNs and GANs.

I am particularly interested in applying AI in real-world domains such as automation, computer vision, and agent-based intelligence. As I continue building my portfolio, I aim to combine deep learning with modern AI frameworks like LangChain, RAG systems, and generative models.
